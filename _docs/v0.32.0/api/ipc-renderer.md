# ipc (renderer)

The `ipc` module provides a few methods so you can send synchronous and
asynchronous messages from the render process (web page) to the main process.
You can also receive replies from the main process.

**Note**: If you want to make use of modules in the main process from the renderer
process, you might consider using the [remote](http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.32.0/api/remote) module.

See [ipc (main process)](http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.32.0/api/ipc-main-process) for code examples.

## Methods

The `ipc` module has the following methods for sending messages:

**Note**: When using these methods to send a `message` you must also listen
for it in the main process with [`ipc (main process)`](http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.32.0/api/ipc-main-process).

### `ipc.send(channel[, arg1][, arg2][, ...])`

* `channel` String - The event name.
* `arg` (optional)

Send an event to the main process asynchronously via a `channel`. Optionally,
there can be a message: one or a series of arguments, `arg`, which can have any
type. The main process handles it by listening for the `channel` event with
`ipc`.

### `ipc.sendSync(channel[, arg1][, arg2][, ...])`

* `channel` String - The event name.
* `arg` (optional)

Send an event to the main process synchronously via a `channel`. Optionally,
there can be a message: one or a series of arguments, `arg`, which can have any
type. The main process handles it by listening for the `channel` event with
`ipc`.

The main process handles it by listening for the `channel` event with `ipc` and
replies by setting the `event.returnValue`.

**Note:** Sending a synchronous message will block the whole renderer process so
using this method is not recommended.

### `ipc.sendToHost(channel[, arg1][, arg2][, ...])`

* `channel` String - The event name.
* `arg` (optional)

Like `ipc.send` but the event will be sent to the host page in a `<webview>`
instead of the main process. Optionally, there can be a message: one or a series
of arguments, `arg`, which can have any type.
